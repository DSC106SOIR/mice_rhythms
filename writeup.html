      <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
      <div class="writeup-box">
        <p>
          The goal of this visualization is to support exploration of biological rhythms‚Äîparticularly how body temperature and activity levels vary across sex and reproductive states in mice. 
          Time is encoded on the X-axis, temperature on the Y-axis, and sex is distinguished using color. 
          Jitter motion and point size reflect activity levels, while background shading indicates day versus night.
        </p>
        <p>
          We introduced two main modes of interaction: 
          <strong>Granularity Mode</strong> enables switching between minute, hour, 12-hour, and daily views with a slider, while 
          <strong>Time Mode</strong> allows users to scrub minute-by-minute through the dataset. These dual modes provide both macro and micro-level perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several visual encoding alternatives were explored, including line charts, heatmaps, and small multiples. 
          We ultimately chose animated scatterplots with jitter because they best highlighted temporal variance and individual differences. 
          Day/night bands were included to align mouse behavior with circadian cycles.

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <div class="writeup-box">
        <p>
          The project took approximately 10‚Äì12 hours of combined development time. 
          Early stages focused on parsing and structuring the dataset into multiple granularities. 
          Core rendering was built with D3, followed by iterative enhancements to the interaction, layout, and mode switching logic.
